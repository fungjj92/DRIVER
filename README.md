# DRIVER
DRIVER - Data for Road Incident Visualization, Evaluation, and Reporting

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WorldBank-Transport/DRIVER.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/WorldBank-Transport/DRIVER)

## Developing

Requires Vagrant 1.5+, Ansible 1.8+ and the following plugins:
  - `vagrant-hostmanager`

Obtain a pickpoint api key from https://pickpoint.io.

Copy `deployment/ansible/group_vars/all.example` to `deployment/ansible/group_vars/all`
and add the API key for pickpoint under `web_js_nominatim_key`.

Install plugins before `vagrant up` via: `vagrant plugin install <plugin-name>`

The app runs on localhost on port 7000. The schema editor is available at /editor/.

A default django superuser will be created, but only on a development provision:
  - username: `admin`
  - password: `admin`

A default OAuth2 application will be created, but only on a development provision.
Navigate to http://localhost:7000/o/applications/ to retrieve the client id/secret after
logging in via http://localhost:70000/admin/

Then run `vagrant up` from the DRIVER repository.

For development, ssh into the app vm with `vagrant ssh app`.

Then, the Angular schema editor is located at: `/opt/schema_editor`
The application Angular frontend is located at: `/opt/web`.

Both Angular apps can be run in development mode via:
```
./scripts/grunt.sh {editor,web} serve
```

The frontend app will be available on port 7002 and the schema editor will be available on port
7001. Both will reload automatically as changes are made.

## Docker

As a shortcut to building the Docker container images contained within the `app`
virtual machine, use the `Makefile` at the root of the project:

```bash
export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://127.0.0.1:2375
make {all,app,editor,web}
```

This will make use of a Docker client installed on the virtual machine host,
telling it to communicate with the Docker daemon on the `app` virtual machine.

## Testing Data

A CSV of historical data can be downloaded from the project /data folder (accidents_and_sites.csv).

Once the app has been built, this data can be loaded.

You will first have to obtain an authorization header. Log in to the web application.
Then open the network tab in web developer tools and reload the page. Inspect the request headers
from an API request and pull out the value of the `Authorization` header, for example
`Token f1acac96cc79c4822e9010d23ab425231d580875`.

Run `python scripts/load_accidents_v3.py --authz 'Token YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN' /path/to/accident_csvs`.
Note that the import process will take roughly two hours for the full data set; you can cut down the
number of records with `head` on the individual CSVs.

To load mock black spots, run `python scripts/load_black_spots.py --authz 'Token YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN' /path/to/black_spots.json`.

To load mock interventions, run `python scripts/load_interventions.py --authz 'Token YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN' /path/to/interventions_sample_pts.geojson`.

## Production

TODO: Notes on creating a production superuser and adding a production OAuth2 application


## Using OAuth2 / Getting tokens

Get a token:
```
curl -X POST -d "grant_type=password&username=<user_name>&password=<password>" -u"<client_id>:<client_secret>" http://localhost:7000/o/token/
```

Returns:
```
{
    "access_token": "<your_access_token>",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 36000,
    "refresh_token": "<your_refresh_token>",
    "scope": "read write groups"
}
```

Making requests with a token:
```
# GET
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>" http://localhost:7000:/api/record/
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>" http://localhost:7000:/api/recordschema/
```

Restricted access (disabled in development to allow access to the browsable API):

Add an additional `scope` parameter to token request:
```
curl -X POST -d "grant_type=password&username=<user_name>&password=<password>&scope=read" -u"<client_id>:<client_secret>" http://localhost:7000/o/token/
```

Now, this token will have read-only access to the API.


## Testing

### Javascript

First, ssh into the app vm: `vagrant ssh app`

Then, cd to the web dir and run the grunt tests: `cd /opt/web && grunt test`
